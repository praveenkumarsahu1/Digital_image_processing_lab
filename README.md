# Digital Image Processing (DIP) 
This repository contains the **Digital Image Processing (DIP) laboratory programs**, implemented as part of the academic coursework. The programs cover fundamental image processing techniques and concepts using Python/OpenCV/Matlab (mention whichever you used).
## 📌 Contents
* Basic image operations (read, display, resize, grayscale, etc.)
* Image enhancement (histogram equalization, contrast stretching, filtering)
* Image transformations (geometric transforms, Fourier transform, DFT, DCT)
* Edge detection (Sobel, Prewitt, Canny)
* Morphological operations (dilation, erosion, opening, closing)
* Image segmentation (thresholding, region-based methods)
* Noise models and restoration
* Additional advanced DIP algorithms
## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this repository is to provide simple, well-documented programs that demonstrate the core concepts of **Digital Image Processing** for learning and academic purposes.
## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/username/DIP-Lab-Programs.git
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd DIP-Lab-Programs
3. Run the required program using Python/Matlab. Example (if Python):
   python program_name.py
## 📝 Notes
* Each program is provided with comments for better understanding.
* Sample input images are included for testing.
* You can modify and experiment with different parameters for deeper learning.
